# User interaction
You will receive a short story intro. You enter your neighbors house while he is away to find evidence against him. To unlock his tablet you need to find 4 paper notes, each of them containing a riddle. Can you crack the code and find out the password?

  ## Four paper notes
  Across the apartment you will find four paper notes with the following riddles on them
  -
  -
  -
  -

  ## Game events


  spider
  rain
  lightning and thunder
  flickering lights


  ## Special interactions 
  Opening drawers, cupboards and doors
  teleportation
  flashlight
  Gun, money and baseball bat (DangerousItems)

  ## Unlocking the tablet
  Once you have found all notes and solved all riddles you will end up with the letters `A`, `G`, `M` and `E`. You should have also found the `I AM GOLDEN` clue scattered multiple times across the apartment. `I AM GOLDEN` depicts its letters in a 3x3 square that lines up with the 3x3 number input of the tablet pin, allowing you to translate the four letters into the four numbers needed for the password. To figure out the correct order of the letters/numbers you should try and find a word. Once you find the word `GAME` and type in the translated number code `4892` on the tablet, you will find it unlocked, revealing various calendar events and emails, but before you really get to read them you hear a gun cocking and your blood scattered across the screen.
